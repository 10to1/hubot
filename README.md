Meechum is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

There are many other robots, but this one is ours.

## How can I add a script?

If it could be useful to more people than just 10to1, create a new github repo `hubot-name-of-your-script`, do advanced cybering, and when done add it as a dependency in `package.json` and `external-scripts.json`.

Make a PR and ping someone on Slack.

Examples:

- [hubot-checkle](https://github.com/pjaspers/hubot-checkle)
- [hubot-mealz](https://github.com/Reprazent/hubot-mealz)
- [hubot-bobsisms](https://github.com/pjaspers/hubot-bobsisms)

BUT MY SCRIPT IS ONLY USEFUL FOR 10TO1?

You can do `comme des animaux` and create a script in the `scripts` folder.

Examples:

- [cue-gif](https://github.com/10to1/hubot/blob/ad990038585b468fb657d282b16ce33aa2ba337f/scripts/cue_gif.coffee)

Make a PR and ping someone on Slack.

BUT MY SCRIPT IS SUPER SECURE FOR 10TO1 EYES ONLY?

This is a not a private repo. Use `ENV` variables as much as possible.

## How do I test this script locally?

You add tests.

## How do I run this locally?

`HUBOT_JANKY_URL=1 bin/hubot -a shell --name meechum`

Now you can talk and `meechum` will listen:

![Like so](https://pile.pjaspers.com/Screen-Shot-2015-09-04-at-18.02.56-81wd2NOx9g.png)

This is a neat way to test out scripts without deploying.

## How do I deploy this?

Ping someone on Slack for access to the Heroku app powering meechum.
